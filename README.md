# IBM Capstone Project

This page contains the notebooks I completed whilst working through the IBM Capstone Project. To complete this project I had to incorporate all of the knowledge that I had built up using the IBM Data Analyst course, which was hosted on Coursera.

Within this project I used the below langauges:

- SQL
- Python

Within Python I used the following libraires to collect, analyse and display the data:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

The project was split into 6 areas, which covered the entire process from data collection to presentation.

| Section | Description | Skills |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [Data Collection](1_Data_Collection) | Within this folder, I worked through different aproaches to data collection. This includes using APIs and using Data Scraping to pull down the data. Within the main project, I accessed the data locally, but these notebooks showcase the different approaches. The notebook [**1.5 Explore the Data Set**](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/1_Data_Collection/1.5%20Explore%20the%20Data%20Set.ipynb) is where I conduct my initial Exploratory Data Analysis   | Data Collection - Initial Data Exploration |
| [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/2_Data_Wrangling/2.1%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb) | Within this notebook, I worked through various Data Wrangling techniques on the aquired Data | Data Wrangling |
| [Data Exploration](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/3_Data_Exploration/3.1%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) | Within this notebook I used multiple libriares to perform Exploratory Data Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis |
