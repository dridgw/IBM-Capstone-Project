# IBM Capstone Project

This page contains the notebooks I completed whilst working through the IBM Capstone Project. To complete this project I had to incorporate all of the knowledge that I had built up using the IBM Data Analyst course, which was hosted on Coursera.

Within this project I used the below langauges:

- SQL
- Python

Within Python I used the following libraires to collect, analyse and display the data:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

The project was split into 6 areas, which covered the entire process from data collection to presentation.

| Section | Description | Skills |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [Data Collection](1_Data_Collection) | Within this folder, I worked through different aproaches to data collection. This includes using APIs and using Data Scraping to pull down the data. Within the main project, I accessed the data locally, but these notebooks showcase the different approaches. The notebook [**1.5 Explore the Data Set**](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/1_Data_Collection/1.5%20Explore%20the%20Data%20Set.ipynb) is where I conduct my initial Exploratory Data Analysis   | Data Collection - Initial Data Exploration |
| [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/2_Data_Wrangling/2.1%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb) | Within this notebook, I worked through various Data Wrangling techniques on the aquired Data | Data Wrangling |
| [Data Exploration](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/3_Data_Exploration/3.1%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) | Within this notebook I used multiple libriares to perform Exploratory Data Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis |
| [Data Visualization](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/4_Data_Visualization/4.1%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb) | In this notebook I used variouse libraries to Visualize the data. I used a different approach to pull the data. The data was hosted in a sqlite file on my machine, so I used SQL Queries within my python code to pull the data. This was an interesting approach as it allowed me to organise my data in either Python or SQL, depending on the approach I wanted to take. | SQL - Data Visualization |
| [Dashboard](https://github.com/dridgw/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/main/5_Dashboard/_%20Project%20Dashboard%20-%202019%20Stack%20Overflow%20Developer%20Survey.pdf) | This pdf shows 3 dashboards built within IBM Cognos Analytics. The Dashboard itself is interactive and can adjust depending on the input | IBM Cognos - Dashboard building |
